# App Planning Lab

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Make sure when you read back your work that you've written things clearly, so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

You will be planning a new application to develop that will be a competitor for another popular application. Your goal is to determine the minimal functionality required so you can launch your app as soon as possible.

Choose from any popular app. It can be an app for anything:

- Music
- TV/Videos
- Shopping
- Social media
- Blog
- Forum (like Stack Overflow or Reddit)
- Chat app
- Recipes
- Business reviews

## Questions

## Project Managing Tool

#### In 1-3 sentences describe your application.

> My app ... will allow users to have a personal profile where they can meet other people that are looking to play sports such as soccer. Games will be hosted by one user. A time, location and player slots will be displayed for the user to know where to go and have a match of soccer!

#### What is the name of your application?

> GamePlan

#### Create a minimum of 10 user stories. Make sure to use the format:

- `As a <type of user>, I want to <some goal>, so that <some reason>.`

Write the user stories below. Add more `>` for each user story or use `-` to make a list

> As a user, I want to have a profile, so that I can keep track of all the games I've played.
> As a user, I want to be able to message other people, so that I am able to form new friendships/teammates.
> As a user, I want to have a visual display of who are the people that will be joining that game, so that I am able to prepare for my games.
> As a user, I want to have the option to surrender my slot, so that games won't be affected in case I can't make it.
> As a user, I want to have a seamless app experience, so that way I can join games faster.
> As a user, I want to be able to host a game, so that way I can build my own community.
> As a user, I want to be able to ban people from my games in case they act violent/agressive, so that way no one gets hurt.
> As a user, I want to see a set of guidelines everyone must follow, so that everyone knows the code of conduct when they join a game.
> As a user, I want to see some tournaments be held, so that everyone gets a chance to showcase their talent.
> As a user, I want to see the location, date and player slots of a game, so that I can plan my day better that way I can attend.

#### Create a new board

Follow the format provided (name of board, the 5 lists etc.) in the reading.

- Add a minimum of 5 cards (front only) based on your user stories to `Backlog`.
- Add appropriate labels.

Provide a link to your board below.

#### For one card, fill out more details, include:

- The business case
- Acceptance criteria
- Notes
- Resources

Move that card to the `Doing` list and assign yourself to it.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [Detailed card](https://trello.com/c/L7tJFmTO)

#### Create one bug card.

Think back to a bug you had in a recent lab or project and do your best to model that example.
It can either be a bug you solved or that you didn't get a chance to solve.

It should include:

- A brief description of the bug.
- The expected behavior.
- The steps to reproduce.
- At least one resource.

Make sure to label it as a bug. Move the card to the `To Do` list.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [Bug card](https://trello.com/c/9loL64O2)

#### Create one chore card

Think back to a chore you had in a recent lab or project and model that example. Move the chore to the `Done` column.

- Assign yourself to it.
- Add a due date.

Provide a link to the specific card below. (remember to add the link, without quotes, in the README.md inside the parenthesis)

### Wireframes

<img src ="./assets/wireframe-small.png" width='500' height='318'>

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository and save the images in the assets folder. For each link below add the url to the parenthesis. No quotes needed in the url address.

**Create a mobile wireframe for the landing page view.**

**Create a landing page wireframe for a wide desktop view.**

**Create a wireframe for a form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view. (mobile or desktop)**

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.

- I learned how to take my time designing a desktop and mobile landing page
- I became inspired on sticking to a plan when creating a website/application
- I got to familiarize myself with Trello more since it is widely used in the industry. It feels good to have this tool in my toolbox now. 

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> One thing I'd improve ... would have to be learning a software that specializes in making wireframes. I have made wireframes before on a sheet and paper. But it'll be great to have a software I can depend on and bring my website to life before all the functionality and code kicks in. 

Please list out your Team Members if you worked on a team:

## Bonus:

### Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
