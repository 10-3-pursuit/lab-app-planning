Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository and save the images in the assets folder. For each link below add the url to the parenthesis. No quotes needed in the url address.

**Create a mobile wireframe for the landing page view.**

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.

- one: I eventually got the hang of organization on Trello.
- two: It made me realize how much easier getting projects done could be when there is a schedule or "To-Do" being followed.
- three: Visual tools help me perform better with less anxiety.

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> One thing I'd improve ...

    Next time, I would practice on time-management and alotting sufficient time between tasks.

Please list out your Team Members if you worked on a team:

1.  N/A

## Bonus:

### Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
