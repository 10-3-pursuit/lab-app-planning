## Bonus:

### Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
