# App Planning Lab

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Make sure when you read back your work that you've written things clearly, so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

### Wireframes

<img src ="./assets/wireframe-small.png" width='500' height='318'>

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository and save the images in the assets folder. For each link below add the url to the parenthesis. No quotes needed in the url address.

**Create a mobile wireframe for the landing page view.**

**Create a landing page wireframe for a wide desktop view.**

[My Desktop Main Page Wireframe Link](./assets/landing-page-desktop.jpeg)

**Create a wireframe for a form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view. (mobile or desktop)**

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.

>- Adding new lists
>- Adding cards to the lists
>- Moving cards to different lists

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> One thing I'd improve would be my descriptions on the cards.

Please list out your Team Members if you worked on a team:

1. Just me

## Bonus:

### Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
