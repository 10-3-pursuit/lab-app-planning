### Wireframes

<img src ="./assets/wireframe-small.png" width='500' height='318'>

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository and save the images in the assets folder. For each link below add the url to the parenthesis. No quotes needed in the url address.

**Create a mobile wireframe for the landing page view.**

[My Mobile Landing Page Wireframe Link] (assets/Untitled_Artwork.jpg)

**Create a landing page wireframe for a wide desktop view.**

[My Desktop Main Page Wireframe Link]()

**Create a wireframe for a form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view. (mobile or desktop)**

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.
 -wireframes
 -using trello
 -coming up with user experience ideas

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> One thing I'd improve is organizing my thoughts when it comes to creating a new project. 

Please list out your Team Members if you worked on a team:

1.

## Bonus:

### Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
