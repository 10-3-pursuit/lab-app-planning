# App Planning Lab

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Make sure when you read back your work that you've written things clearly, so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

You will be planning a new application to develop that will be a competitor for another popular application. Your goal is to determine the minimal functionality required so you can launch your app as soon as possible.

Choose from any popular app. It can be an app for anything:

- Music
- TV/Videos
- Shopping
- Social media
- Blog
- Forum (like Stack Overflow or Reddit)
- Chat app
- Recipes
- Business reviews

## Questions

## Project Managing Tool
TRELLO

#### In 1-3 sentences describe your application.

> My app is a music streaming app. Our main competitor(s) are Spotify and Apple Music. The unique nature of my app, is that it includes several remixes to popular songs -- flipped into varying genres, done by different DJs/producers from various cities and many other parts of the world. 

#### What is the name of your application?

> 'Groovify'

#### Create a minimum of 10 user stories. Make sure to use the format:

- `As a <type of user>, I want to <some goal>, so that <some reason>.`
-As a first-time user, I want to ensure smooth functionailty to minimize frustration.
-As a repeat-user, I want to make sure new discovery leads to continued revisits.
-As a referred-user, I want to make sure the hype of expectations is met above/beyond.
-As a regular user, I want to minimize the time it takes for successful song searches.
-As a music aficianado, I want to thrill the listener with never heard before remixes.
-As a dedicated user, I want to encourage the creation of profiles to build community.
-As a regular user, I want to offer new perks according to their favorable algorithms.
-As a regular user, I want to retain subscribers seamlessly, building app popularity.
-As a dedicated user, I want to be able to build playlists, connect to other users.
-As a paid subscriber, a curated playlist of songs/remixes are sent to them weekly.

Write the user stories below. Add more `>` for each user story or use `-` to make a list

-As a user, the app should have a quality of sound & diffrentiate itself from others.
-As a user, the app has an ability to help the user contact us via email or live chat.
-As a user, the patterns of songs played or liked can automatically recommend similar.
-As a user subscriber, there's an ease of dated, reoccuring, monthly auto-billing.
-As a user, searching for songs and remixes must be the ultimate in optimized results.

#### Create a new board

Follow the format provided (name of board, the 5 lists etc.) in the reading.

- Add a minimum of 5 cards (front only) based on your user stories to `Backlog`.
- Add appropriate labels.

Provide a link to your board below.

> [GROOVIFY APP LAUNCH board](https://trello.com/b/z3VLR2Ct/kanban-template)
> [BACKLOG Card LINK] (https://trello.com/c/5hc9Ybv3)

#### For one card, fill out more details, include:

- The business case: especially for subscribers, we want to make sure the reoccurring payments are seamless, whether it's on a monthly plan or on a yearly plan (calculated even less expensive than the monthly plan for 1yr), automatically deducted from the user's account.
- Acceptance criteria: if you like dope music, we welcome one and all to listen for free, but every few songs will be interrupted by paid ads for the free user. As a paid subscriber, monthly or annually, the user will need to have a bank account or provide an unexpired credit card#, and the user can enjoy ad-free uninterrupted music streaming, as long as they maintain their subscription.
- Notes: be meticulous in all the steps before launch, but be aware that we need to work with a steady pace to make sure we launch before our competitors relaunch their apps. Also, there are notes in the Backlog card, pay attention in the next few days to the 'TO DO' card, where delegated assigned tasks will be given.
- Resources: exclusive DJs/Producers have access to submit-only music/songs to the team, giving us the edge in unique remixes and tracks that are only exclusively available on our app. Every week we will notify certain team members to accept these tracks and upload to the server when we launch. Here's a link to releases awaiting approval: https://marlonpelau.github.io/web-inventory-app-vinylmania/

Move that card to the `Doing` list and assign yourself to it.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [Detailed 'DOING' card](https://trello.com/c/w8oZfEe8/4-doing)

#### Create one bug card.

Think back to a bug you had in a recent lab or project and do your best to model that example.
It can either be a bug you solved or that you didn't get a chance to solve.

It should include:

- A brief description of the bug: In the terminal for VS Vode for one of my labs `lab-intro-to-dom` it's not pushing to the repo, there's a fail/error message every time I attempt `git push origin main` and this is the error message:
(
âžœ  lab-intro-to-dom git:(main) git push origin main
remote: Permission to 10-3-pursuit/lab-intro-to-dom.git denied to MarlonPelau.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/10-3-pursuit/lab-intro-to-dom.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403)
- The expected behavior: `git push origin main` supposed to allow me to make changes to this difficult lab in VS Code, push it to the repo in github, and update this lab so I could resubmit all my edits and changes.
- The steps to reproduce: not sure, have tried many fixes but no success.
- At least one resource: https://github.com/10-3-pursuit/lab-intro-to-dom

Make sure to label it as a bug. Move the card to the `To Do` list.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [Bug card](https://trello.com/c/mfAqceyp)

#### Create one chore card

Think back to a chore you had in a recent lab or project and model that example. Move the chore to the `Done` column.

- Assign yourself to it: 'done', no pun intended.
- Add a due date: 11/8/2023

Provide a link to the specific card below. (remember to add the link, without quotes, in the README.md inside the parenthesis)

> [Chore card](https://trello.com/c/w8oZfEe8)

### Wireframes

<img src ="./assets/wireframe-small.png" width='500' height='318'>

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository and save the images in the assets folder. For each link below add the url to the parenthesis. No quotes needed in the url address.

**Create a mobile wireframe for the landing page view.**

[My Mobile Landing Page Wireframe Link]()

**Create a landing page wireframe for a wide desktop view.**

[My Desktop Main Page Wireframe Link]()

**Create a wireframe for a form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view. (mobile or desktop)**

[My Form Wireframe Link]()

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.

- one: approaching this like it was a real app, like it was my baby w/details.
- two: language is quite important in code, and I realize in a lot of the assignments, it's not the best. As a writer/copywriter/journalist, I plan to improve that any change I get, including all assignments that require clear and concise writing. I think I do that well in this lab.
- three: finding the links to insert, the ideation of really going through this like it was a real app situation.

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> One thing I'd improve is not trying to do all of this lab in one sitting, but I'll admit, after a project like the last, I was looking forward to a little break and pause in lab assignments. I put in about 20hrs alone over the weekend on the project. So I may or may not attempt the ## Bonus question.

Please list out your Team Members if you worked on a team:

1. Marlon Regis, period the end.

## Bonus:

### Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
